# Random Items Mod

## General info
**WARNING! MOD IS CURRENTLY IN ALPHA TESTING!**\
RIM is a simple mod that allows you to play **random items minigame** or even **create your own!**\
Random items minigame is a game where you get random items **every n ticks/seconds** and the last standing wins!\
All you need to start is an arena. It can be a simple platform or even two pillars.\
Also, you can try out the ready-to-play official map.\
To start the game, you can simply execute the ```/start [delay_ticks]``` command!\
But if you want to set up the game in your own settings, you can use the following documentation: [Random Items Mod docs]().\
If you want to suggest an idea, post it on issues with the suggested tag! I'll be very grateful for any of your ideas!\
